quintagroup.portlet.collection installation
-------------------------------------------

To install quintagroup.portlet.collection into the global Python environment
(or a workingenv), using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* Copy ``quintagroup`` folder to the ``/path/to/instance/lib/python`` directory.

* Create a file called ``quintagroup.portlet.collection-configure.zcml`` in the
  ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
  should only contain this::

    <include package="quintagroup.portlet.collection" />

Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``quintagroup.portlet.collection`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.portlet.collection

* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        quintagroup.portlet.collection

After that:

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::

    $ ./bin/buildout

* Restart Zope server process, for example, with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/zopectl restart

Then install quintagroup.portlet.collection with Quickinstaller in Plone.
