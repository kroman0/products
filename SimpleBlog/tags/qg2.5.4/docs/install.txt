Installing SimpleBlog


Requirements:
    * Plone 2.1 or higher (this version will NOT work with previous versions)
    * Archetypes 1.3.x
    * ATContentTypes 1.0.3 or higher

Install:
    * Copy the entire SimpleBlog folder to your zope Products folder and restart Zope
    * Use QuickInstaller to install SimleBlog into your Plone site.

During the installation, SimpleBlog creates a workflow that is attached to the BlogEntry portal type.
This workflow is very simple and has two states: 'draft' and 'published'. Of course you can create your
own workflow but this one is made for your convenience. Of course you can also use the standard plone workflow.

Also, a simpleblog_tool is installed in the portal which gives you a few parameters that you can 
adjust for SimpleBlog. In your Plone site there is a control panel for SimpleBlog. See readme.txt for more info.

When the installation is finished, you should check the permissions in ZMI for your portal. There will be four
new permissions:  SimpleBlog: Add Blog, SimpleBlog: Add BlogEntry, SimpleBlog: Add BlogFolder and SimpleBlog: Cross-post.
You most certainly will have to assign roles, otherwise no one will be able to add Blogs other than the Manager.

IMPORTANT for users of versions prior to 2.0:
You will have to remove and re-install SimpleBlog in order to register the new factory types for plone 2.1. Make sure you backup your
data first!!

That's about all. Don't forget to read the readme!
