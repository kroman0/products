RPCAuth is a rip off of the great CookieCrumbler product.  It is
designed to allow users of XML-RPC methods to pass their username and
password as arguments.  It works on the same principle as the
CookieCrumbler allowing the transparent use of existing UserFolders,
just add a RPCAuth instance to the folder where your acl_users is
located.
