Export adapters section
=======================

The export adapters section blueprint name is
``quintagroup.transmogrifier.exportadapters``.

Export adapters needs at least 2 piece of information: the path to the object
to update and data dictionary which determine, what adapters will be queried and
what data they will consume. To determine the path, the marshall section inspects
each item and looks for one key, as described below. Any item missing this piece of
information will be skipped. Similarly, items with a path that doesn't exist
or without data dictionary will be skipped too.

Paths to objects are always interpreted as relative to the context.
