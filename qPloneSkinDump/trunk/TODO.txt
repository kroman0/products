*** TODO LIST ***

  - improvements in resource dumping
  - refactor portal_view_customizations dump
  - add dump of portal_properties
  - add dump of viewlets.xml
  - add dump of portlets.xml
  - core refactorization, divide into small chunks all functionality (too difficult to upgrade current skindump structure)
       * maybe using zope 3 component architecture
maybe in future:
  - refactor qPloneSkinDump to work with python paster package, for use ZopeSkel templates styling
