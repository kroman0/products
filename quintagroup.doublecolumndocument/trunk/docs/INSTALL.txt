quintagroup.doublecolumndocument Installation
=============================================

To install quintagroup.doublecolumndocument into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* Copy ``quintagroup`` folder to the ``/path/to/instance/lib/python`` directory.

* Create a file called ``quintagroup.doublecolumndocument-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file should only
   contain this::

       <include package="quintagroup.doublecolumndocument" />

Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``quintagroup.doublecolumndocument`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        quintagroup.doublecolumndocument
        
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
  
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        quintagroup.doublecolumndocument
   
After that:

* Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
        
* Restart the Zope server, for example with the following command in the terminal::

   $ ./bin/zopectl restart

* Install quintagroup.doublecolumndocument with Quickinstaller in Plone.
